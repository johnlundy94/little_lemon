# Little Lemon 🍋

## Description

Little Lemon is a website that brings to life the ambiance of a fictional restaurant. Designed and developed as the culminating project for the Front-End Development Certification program with Meta, it showcases a blend of aesthetic design with robust functionality. A key highlight is its reservations system, built meticulously to ensure users a seamless experience when reserving tables, while simultaneously avoiding overlaps in booking times.

## Installation

To get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands:

\```bash
npm i
npm start
\```


## Usage

To make the most out of Little Lemon's features, head over to the reservations form. This form has been fortified with various technologies to guarantee a smooth user experience:

- **Form Validation**: Courtesy of `yup` and `formik`, ensuring that users input the right information in the right format.
- **Firebase Backend**: Making double bookings a thing of the past. Our system checks existing reservations to ensure there aren't any overlaps.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: As the cornerstone of our front-end.
- **Firebase**: Serving as our reliable backend.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thank you to Meta's Front-End Certification program. This project would not have been possible without the knowledge and skills imbibed during the course.
